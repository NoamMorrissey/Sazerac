<h3>What is it about?</h3>
--------------------------

Sazerac is a cocktail of documents and files that can help you rapidly (and deliciously) develop a website. Sazerac is not just a straight-up CSS boilerplate, it is a hardcore concoction of the base ingredients: web target analysis, prototype and wireframing, and design creation in Fireworks. Finally, we mix this all together with CSS code generation, and voila, your Sazerac UX cocktail!

<h4>Design book</h4>
The Sazerac "Design Book" is your web site recipe: client and user analyses, definition of personas and scenarios, creation of task flow, and wireframing.

<h4>Design Templates</h4>
The Sazerac "Design Templates" are your base ingredients: various Fireworks templates that you can use straight-up or mix and match with your own personal designs. Don't be afraid to experiment. <strong>Do have fun.</strong>

<h4>CSS Boilerplate</h4>
Sazerac's CSS Boilerplate is the final, tasty twist: a collection of totally modifiable CSS files to finalize your design and publish your web, in any device imagineable.<strong> Bottoms up!</strong>


<h3>Who &amp; why</h3>
--------------------------
The mixologist behind Sazerac is me, Alfonso Morcuende. I've worked as a graphic desinger in sunny Spain for 15+ years. I've been involved in dozens of web projects and in all phases of web site creation from initial client analysis to layout and coding for all sorts of devices. I have always been obsessed with finding a comprehensive method to neatly cover alll these initial aspects of a web project. This is exactly what Sazarec does. Sazerac is a collection of the best techniques I have found in years of searching. Everything you need to create a web site is here, all you have to do is shake it up to create your own Sazerac cocktail.

<h3>How do I get started</h3>
--------------------------
Sazerac is not a solution for every aspect of your web project, but I sincerely believe it offers a good start, no matter what your objectives, nor your design.

<strong>The structure of Sazerac is:</strong>
<h4>Sazerac Design Book:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Card-template.pdf</strong>: print this page if you are preparing a card shorting.</li>
  <li><strong>Sazerac-book.pdf</strong>: this docuemnt allows you to collect all the information necessary to jumpstart your project (analysis, application design and prototypes). Read it carefully and use the parts you find most useful.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sazerac Templates:</h4>
Various <strong>PNG files you can open with Fireworks</strong> and use to get started creating your own delicious designs

<h4>Sazerac CSS Boilerplate:</h4>
Here is the CSS core of Sazerac. Open the file <strong>variables.less</strong>, modify it with the values you want. Next open <strong>sazerac.less</strong> and compile the file to get your personalized CSS cocktail.
